# Project Title
# Diabetic prediction using machine learning

1. I developed a project to predict diabetes using supervised machine learning, with the Pima Indian dataset as the foundation. 
2. In this project, I built a "graphical user interface (GUI)" that allows users to input their own health data, such as diagnostic measurements, and receive predictions on whether they may have diabetes based on the trained model. 
3. The goal is to create a user-friendly tool for early diabetes risk detection and assessment
